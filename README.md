# pk-2-and-3-dof-strip-theory-time-and-frerqueny-domain
Codes used in the development of my Bachelor Thesis to implement a pk method on simple wings.


This repository contains a set of files arranged in two folders, each of them to analyze 2 and 3 degree of freedom simple aeroelastic systems. 

These files implement a pk analysis over a simple finite wing, following the approach described in Wright and Cooper. Additionally, a time domain simulation of the system is included, with Theodorsen's aerodynamics approximated in time domain with R.T.Jones RFA. A GRFP system identification algorithm is employed, using the codes developed by F.M.A. Mitrotta to implement it.
