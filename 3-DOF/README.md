# pk_strip_theory_aileron_full_span_numerical_mode_shapes 
This script implements a pk method on a 3dof finite wing with a trailing edge aileron along the entire span. It is a limiting case that cannot be performed with the other script included here. The displacements for the mode shapes are numerically integrted t allow for easy manipulations of the geometry.
 

# pk_strip_theory_aileron_not_full_span_numerical_mode_shapes 
This file is very similar to the one described above but allows for the modification of the size of the trailing edge aileron, allowing its size to vary by specifying its initial and final coordinates at the trailing edge, as a percentage of the semispan.
